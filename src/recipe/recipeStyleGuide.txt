📌 Recipe Style Guide

    JSON format
        The recipe should be stored like so:
            {
                title:
                subtitle:
                miseenplace: [
                    {ingredient: "Red Onion", preparation: "Finely diced", amount: [[1,"Cup"],[1,"large"]]},
                    {group: "Dry ingredients", ingredients: [
                        
                    ]}

                    ]
                ]

            }


    Title & Subtitle

        Provide a clear dish name as the title.

        Use the subtitle to list:
            Serving suggestions (e.g., “Serve over rice or toast”)
            Garnishes or toppings (e.g., “Top with green onion or chili flakes”)

    Mise en Place (Ingredients List)

        Ingredients sorted in this order (but do not show category labels):
            Dry ingredients
            Liquid ingredients
            Vegetables
            Dairy
            Fresh herbs
            Onions
            Garlic, Ginger, other Aromatics
            Animal products (e.g., meat, eggs)

        Use abbreviations for units where appropriate:
        tsp, TBSP, C, lb, etc.

        If an ingredient is used in more than one step with different quantities, list it separately for each use.

        Equivalents are formatted like:
        1 C or 2 sticks

        Group ingredients only if they are intentionally mixed before use (e.g., spice mix, marinade).

    Instructions

        Use a numbered list.

        Every step starts with a hook: a short, action-oriented summary of the step (e.g., “Toast the seeds.” “Add the garlic.”).

        If a time-based wait or action is included, begin a new step after it.

        Do not abbreviate units in this section (write “tablespoons,” not “TBSP”).

        Refer to ingredients using the shortest descriptive name necessary.

        If preheating the oven is required, this must be Step 1.

        Notes may be inserted between steps and must begin with NOTE: but are not numbered.
